# Redux Counter

**STAGE 1**

Create a counte with three functionality i.e `increment` `decrement` and `reset`.

- Clicking on `increment` will increment the value by 1.
- Clicking on `decrement` will decrement the value 1.
- Reset will reset the value to 0

**STAGE 2**

Limit the increment or decrement value to be between between 0 - 100. Or else `alert` error message.

**STAGE 3**

Make a additional set of button which will have 5,8,10,12,14,16 as values. By default the value should increment or decrement by 1. But when you click on one of these button like say (5) it should increment or decrement by the value 5.
